**Regression and Classification Lab**

My hands-on exploration of two foundational machine learning algorithms: **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression**.

This repository demonstrates the training and prediction workflows for both regression models using simulated datasets. It provides a side-by-side implementation and visualization of both learning paradigms in a single script.

> 🐣 *This project marks my baby step into the world of machine learning.* 🚀

## 🧠 Models Implemented

* **Linear Regression**
  Predicts continuous values using a simple linear model trained via gradient descent.

* **Logistic Regression**
  Classifies binary outcomes using a logistic model, also trained with gradient descent.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
main/
├── linearRegression/        # Linear regression training logic
├── logisticRegression/      # Logistic regression training logic
├── ml_utils/                # Shared utility functions (training + prediction)
├── main-regression.py       # Main script for training and visualizing both models
└── README.md                # Project documentation
```

Ensure that the modules (`ml_utils`, `train_*`, `predict_*`) are implemented correctly and available in the import path.

## 📌 Notes

* This is a simplified lab environment and does not include test automation or dataset generalization.
* Simulated data is used to validate the core ideas of both models.
* Basic visualizations are included to better understand model performance.
